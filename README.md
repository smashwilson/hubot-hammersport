# Hammersport for Hubot

A co-worker of mine once passed through a town called Hammondsport on his trips home. This led him to idly invent an extreme sport called "hammersport". In his words:

> "Two combatants enter the chalk circle, bound together at the wrist. In each of their other hands is a claw hammer. It's over when there's a winner."

So, naturally, we made a mini role-playing game out of it. And, naturally, I'm porting it to Hubot.
